Welcome  **KneelsoN-Dev** Portfolio!

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Recommended version: >= 16.x)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/KneelsoN-Dev.git

    Navigate to the project directory:

cd KneelsoN-Dev

Install dependencies:

npm install

Or, if you're using Yarn:

    yarn install

Recommended IDE Setup

For the best development experience, we recommend using the following setup:

    Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as your code editor.
    Volar for Vue 3 support (disable Vetur if it's already installed).

With this setup, you'll get features like:

    IntelliSense for Vue components and TypeScript
    Type checking for .vue files

Development
Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

To start the development server with hot module replacement (HMR), run:

npm run dev

This will launch the app in development mode, and any changes you make will automatically be reflected in the browser.
Type-Check, Compile, and Minify for Production

To build the app for production, compile the code, and minify it for optimal performance:

npm run build
